# Lab 10: The Ride-Hailing Service, Part 2

## Objectives
Create a ride-hailing service --both the client and server. Parts 1 and 2 are the client, and part 3 will be the server.

Lab #10, Part 2 - populate the map with dynamic content --information that changes over time. That is, you request a ride, and vehicles available will be displayed on map.

## Completion Status
- [x] Determine your geolocation and place a marker
- [x] Make a request to the ride-hailing API and each vehicle on the map shall be a marker with a car icon
- [x] Upon clicking on your marker on the map, display an information window noting the closest vehicle from where you are including the distance away in miles
- [x] Render a polyline that connects "your" marker to the marker of the closest vehicle.
#### Going Beyond
- [x] Upon clicking on a marker for a vehicle, show popup infowindow noting how far away the vehicle is, in miles, from you.
